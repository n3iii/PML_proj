# PML_proj
Practical Machine Learning project

This project will have 2 files.  The main file is pmlProj.html.  You can access the
web page at:

http://n3iii.github.io/PML_proj/pmlProj.html

The project will compare 5 models based on trees on their expected accuracy from the training subset, their actual accuracy on the test subset, and their elapsed run time.

All of the code chunks are displayed in the Appendix of the HTML report, in case that is easier for you to see than the actual Rmd file.

By the way, the predictions of Bagged Tree and Random Forests on the 20 row submission set were correct.
