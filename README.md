# PML_proj
Practical Machine Learning project

http://n3iii.github.io/PML_proj/pmlProj.html

This is the main file of the project.  All of the code chunks are displayed in the Appendix of the HTML report, in case that is easier for you to see than the actual Rmd file.

The project will compare 5 models based on trees on their expected accuracy from the training subset, their actual accuracy on the test subset, and their elapsed run time.

The Rmd file is also included in this repo.  

By the way, the predictions of Bagged Tree and Random Forests on the 20 row submission set were correct.
